```

This will:

### Manual Recommendation Engine

If you want to work with the recommendation engine directly:

```python
# Example usage
from src.recommendations.recommender import MusicRecommender
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
features_df = pd.read_csv("data/audio_features.csv")  # If you have features
tracks_df = pd.read_csv("data/user_data_20250725_125118.csv")

# Initialize recommender
recommender = MusicRecommender(features_df, tracks_df)

# Get recommendations for a specific track
recommendations = recommender.find_similar_tracks("track_id_here", n_recommendations=10)

# Get mood-based recommendations
chill_tracks = recommender.get_mood_based_recommendations("chill", n_recommendations=15)
energetic_tracks = recommender.get_mood_based_recommendations("energetic", n_recommendations=15)

# Create a playlist from multiple seed tracks
playlist = recommender.create_playlist_recommendations(
    seed_tracks=["track1", "track2", "track3"],
    playlist_length=25,
    diversity_factor=0.3
)
```
